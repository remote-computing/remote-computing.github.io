For quite some time now I've run Ubuntu servers in AWS and become a fan of the OS, especially for web hosting. I've been happily powering on my server(s), updating AWS security groups as necessary and SSH'ing onto the server. Some of them I leave running, but occasionally I'd forget to power off a test server after some development work due to some distraction or just giving up and going to bed.

Now I've realised how good Windows Subsystem for Linux is!
